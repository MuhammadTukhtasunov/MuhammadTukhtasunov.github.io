                     Problem Statement: Unifying Platform

                    College students need a way to unify the multiple platforms that each class is using in order to have an efficient workflow and stay focused. This will help them succeed in classes and relieve any anxiety. The problem has been caused becuase of the Covid 19 pandemic, and as a result classes have moved online, so teachers are using multiple programs for classwork. This can be confusing and overwhelming.

                  With our team, Team Whiskey, we decided on what personas would be best fitting for this problem statement and who would be most likely to use it, and we allocated each persona to a person and they finalised it.
