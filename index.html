                        College students need a way to unify the multiple platforms that each class is using in order to have an efficient workflow and stay focused. This will help them succeed in classes and relieve any anxiety. The problem has been caused becuase of the Covid 19 pandemic, and as a result classes have moved online, so teachers are using multiple programs for classwork. This can be confusing and overwhelming.

                    In our team of 4, we each made a sketch for how we thought the app should look. The drawings we each made looked like they were in stages. One was a hand drawing, one was a digital drawing, one was a wireframe, and mine was almost like a prototype(colorized). We decided to put the wireframe as our first because it had captions that explained the app better.

                    Using our individual sketches from last week, we each made our own paper prototypes. Since my last sketch was made using Adobe Illustrator. I downloaded the sketches on my phone and using alittle bit of video magic, I made it look like I was using an actual app.

                    Using our paper prototypes that we individually created last week, each of our team members tested the paper prototype on atleast 2 people. I personally tested it on my older sister, a USC junior, and my friend, a USC freshman. I have the scenarios listed as well as the results.

                   Using Proto.io, along with Team Whiskey, we created a high fidelity prototype for our project. We used the lo-fi prototype we made last assignment and expanded upon it. We also made it fully functional and colored. The user input is actually accepted and used in the app, as it would if it was a legitimate app.
